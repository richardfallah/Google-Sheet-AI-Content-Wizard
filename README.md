ï‚§	gpt-4o-mini.js (balance of cost and performance)
o	Select the script file that corresponds to the model you want to use.
2.	Open Script Editor:
o	In your Google Sheet, go to "Extensions" > "Apps Script."
3.	Copy and Paste the Script:

Important Notes
â€¢	API Usage: Be mindful of your OpenAI API usage and potential costs. Monitor your usage on the OpenAI platform.
â€¢	Error Handling: The script does not include extensive error handling. Consider adding try...catch blocks to handle potential errors during API calls or web scraping.
â€¢	Adjust max_tokens: Modify the max_tokens parameter in each function to control the length of the generated content.
â€¢	Customize Prompts: Feel free to adjust the prompts in each function to better suit your specific needs and preferences.
â€¢	Website Scraping: The analyzeWebsiteAndSuggestOutreach function uses IMPORTXML to scrape website content. You might need to adjust the XPath expression (//p) based on the website structure.
â€¢	Column Order: Do not alter the column order, add, or remove columns in the sheet without updating the corresponding column indexes in the script. For example, if you move "Website URL" to column G, you need to change 'F' + (i + 1) to 'G' + (i + 1) in the analyzeWebsiteAndSuggestOutreach function.
This comprehensive guide should help you effectively install and utilize the script for generating sales content and analyzing websites.
